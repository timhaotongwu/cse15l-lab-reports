## Part 1 - Researching Commands - Consider the commands less, find, and grep. Choose one of them. Online, find 4 interesting command-line options or alternate ways to use the command you chose.

`grep`: is a command used in searching and matching text files contained in the regular expressions. There are some alternative for `grep` are `ack.`, `ripgrep`, `sed` and `egrep`.

`ack`: is a tool specifically designed for code searching, with built-in support for various programming languages. It recursively searches directories by default and ignores version control directories and binary files.

`ripgrep`: is another fast and feature-rich line-oriented search tool. It is designed to be faster than both grep and ag and supports searching with regular expressions, recursive searching, and respecting gitignore rules.
